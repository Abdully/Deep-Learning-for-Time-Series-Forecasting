## How to Prepare Time Series Data for CNNs and LSTMs

- Time series data must be transformed before it can be used to Ô¨Åt a supervised learning model
- The two-dimensional structure of the supervised learning data must be transformed to a three-dimensional structure

### After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- How to transform a time series dataset into a two-dimensional supervised learning format.
- How to transform a two-dimensional time series dataset into a three-dimensional structure suitable for CNNs and LSTMs.
- How to step through a worked example of splitting a very long time series into subsequences ready for training a CNN or LSTM model.
